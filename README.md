Project for Lilygo's  T-BEAM Lineup. Project for an University about marine life.

For now it's an empty REPO. But over time we will be adding vibe-coded BS to this.
Also we don't know anything about CPP, so expect errors all over the explanation of the projects and others!

For now all the collaborators of this REPO should follow the next guide to survive: https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGo-LoRa-Series/blob/master/docs/en/t_beam/t_beam_hw.md
